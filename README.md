This is the official iOS SDK for StreamVideo, a platform for building apps with video and audio calling support. The repository includes both a low-level SDK and a set of reusable UI components, available in both UIKit and SwiftUI.

## What is Stream?

Stream allows developers to rapidly deploy scalable feeds, chat messaging and video with an industry leading 99.999% uptime SLA guarantee.

With Stream's video components, you can use our SDK to build in-app video calling, audio rooms, audio calls, or live streaming. The best place to get started is with our tutorials:

- [Video & Audio Calling Tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/ios/tutorial/video-calling/)
- [Audio Rooms Tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/ios/tutorial/audio-room/)
- [Livestreaming Tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/ios/tutorial/livestreaming/)

Stream provides UI components and state handling that make it easy to build video calling for your app. All calls run on Stream's network of edge servers around the world, ensuring optimal latency and reliability.

## 👩‍💻 Free for Makers 👨‍💻

Stream is free for most side and hobby projects. To qualify, your project/company needs to have < 5 team members and < $10k in monthly revenue. Makers get $100 in monthly credit for video for free.

## Repo Overview 😎

This repository contains the following parts:
- low-level client for calling (can be used standalone if you want to build your own UI)
- SwiftUI SDK (UI components developed in SwiftUI)
- UIKit SDK (wrappers for easier usage in UIKit apps)

### Main Principles

- Progressive disclosure: The SDK can be used easily with very minimal knowledge of it. As you become more familiar with it, you can dig deeper and start customizing it on all levels.
- Swift native API: Uses Swift's powerful language features to make the SDK usage easy and type-safe.
- Familiar behavior: The UI elements are good platform citizens and behave like native elements; they respect `tintColor`, padding, light/dark mode, dynamic font sizes, etc.
- Fully open-source implementation: You have access to the complete source code of the SDK on GitHub.

### Low-Level Client

The low-level client is used for establishing audio and video calls. It integrates with Stream's backend infrastructure, and implements the WebRTC protocol.

Here are the most important components that the low-level client provides:
- `StreamVideo` - the main SDK object.
- `Call` - an object that provides info about the call state, as well as methods for updating it.

#### StreamVideo

This is the main object for interfacing with the low-level client. It needs to be initialized with an API key and a user/token, before the SDK can be used.

```swift
let streamVideo = StreamVideo(
    apiKey: "key1",
    user: user.userInfo,
    token: user.token,
    videoConfig: VideoConfig(),
    tokenProvider: { result in
      yourNetworkService.loadToken(completion: result)
    }
)
```

#### Call

The `Call` class provides all the information about the call, such as its participants, whether the call is being recorded, etc. It also provides methods to perform standard actions available during a call, such as muting/unmuting users, sending reactions, changing the camera input, granting permissions, recording, etc.

You can create a new `Call` via the `StreamVideo`'s method `func call(callType: String, callId: String, members: [Member])`.

### SwiftUI SDK

The SwiftUI SDK provides out of the box UI components, ready to be used in your app.

The simplest way to add calling support to your hosting view is to attach the `CallModifier`:

```swift
struct CallView: View {

    @StateObject var viewModel: CallViewModel

    init() {
        _viewModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: CallViewModel())
    }

    var body: some View {
        HomeView(viewModel: viewModel)
            .modifier(CallModifier(viewModel: viewModel))
    }
}

```

You can customize the look and feel of the screens presented in the calling flow, by implementing the corresponding methods in our `ViewFactory`.

Most of our components are public, so you can use them as building blocks if you want to build your custom UI.

All the texts, images, fonts and sounds used in the SDK are configurable via our `Appearance` class, to help you brand the views to be inline with your hosting app.

### UIKit SDK

The UIKit SDK provides UIKit wrappers around the SwiftUI views. Its main integration point is the `CallViewController` which you can easily push in your navigation stack, or add as a modal screen.

```swift
private func didTapStartButton() {
    let next = CallViewController.make(with: callViewModel)
    next.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
    next.startCall(
            callType: "default",
            callId: callId,
            members: members
        )
    self.navigationController?.present(next, animated: true)
}
```

The `CallViewController` is created with a `CallViewModel` - the same one used in our SwiftUI SDK.

At the moment, all the customizations in the UIKit SDK, need to be done in SwiftUI.

- changing the codec that's used from VP8 to h264 or vice versa
- detecting when webrtc changes the resolution of the f track, and notifying the server about it (if needed)
