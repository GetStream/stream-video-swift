### Livestream Quickstart


In this quickstart we'll build a livestreaming experience that's similar to Twitch. 

* The livestream will run on Stream's Edge network of servers around the world
* You can use ultra low latency (webrtc) based livestreaming or HLS (slight delay, but better buffering)
* We'll show how to publish to the livestream from your phone or RTMP
* Exporting to RTMP is also covered
* Stream enables you to scale to millions of viewers
* You can have multiple active participants in the livestream

Alright, let's get started! If you want to see a fully fledged example, check out this sample app.

### Step 1 - Prep

Be sure to follow the steps in install and authentication

### Step 2 - Publishing your livestream

A. Publish your camera's video feed to a call.

B. Add an RTMP feed to the call


### Join the call on the web interface

### Step 3 - Show the video using HLS or Webrtc

A. Webrtc Example
AA. Join as a participant
AB. Join as a speaker

B. HLS example

Talk about the benefits of each approach

(HLS is cheaper and has good buffering. But has a delay of 8 seconds or so. Webrtc is ultra low latency, but has a higher cost and worse buffering.)

### Step 4 - Some smaller livestream specific stuff

- Participant count?
- Show how long the stream has been running
- Link to docs on the chat integration
- Manually changing the displayed quality
- Muting the audio of the livestream

### Step 5 - Exporting to RTMP & Recording
