//TODO: update this.

You can listen to call events if you want to provide your custom handling, that's different then the one implemented in our `CallViewModel`.

The call events are available as an [AsyncStream](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream) of `CallEvent`s. The `CallEvent` enumeration has the following values:
- `incoming(IncomingCall)` - called when the current user receives an incoming call. Should be used to display an incoming call UI.
- `accepted(CallEventInfo)` - called when a user has accepted a call initiated by the current user.
- `rejected(CallEventInfo)` - called when a user has rejected a call initiated by the current user.
- `canceled(CallEventInfo)` - called when a call was canceled, mostly due to a timeout or if the user that rings decided to hang up.
- `ended(CallEventInfo)` - called when a call was ended for everyone by an admin.
- `userBlocked(CallEventInfo)` - called when a user was blocked during a call.
- `userUnblocked(CallEventInfo)` - called when a user was unblocked during a call.

### Reacting to Incoming Call events

When the incoming call event is received, you will need to provide handling in your custom implementation. The handling should result into triggering one of the other events (call accepted, rejected or canceled) to the other side.

You should use the methods provided by the `StreamVideo` object to react to incoming call events. 

#### Accepting a call

Accepting a call can be done by calling the `acceptCall(callId: String, callType: String)` method from the `StreamVideo` object. Additionally, when you accept a call, you should also join it, by creating an instance of the `Call` object and calling its `join` method.

Here's an example implementation from our `CallViewModel`:

```swift
public func acceptCall(callId: String, type: String) {
    Task {
        try await streamVideo.acceptCall(callId: callId, callType: type)
        enterCall(callId: callId, callType: type, members: [])
    }
}

private func enterCall(callId: String, callType: String, members: [User], ring: Bool = false) {
    Task {
        do {
            log.debug("Starting call")
            let call = streamVideo.makeCall(callType: callType, callId: callId, members: members)
            try await call.join(ring: ring, callSettings: callSettings)
            save(call: call)
        } catch {
            log.error("Error starting a call \(error.localizedDescription)")
            self.error = error
            callingState = .idle
        }
    }
}
```

#### Rejecting a call

In order to reject a call, you should call `StreamVideo`'s `rejectCall(callId: String, type: String)` method. This will trigger the `rejected` call event to all involved participants, and you should use this to hide the incoming / outgoing call screens.

```swift
public func rejectCall(callId: String, type: String) {
    Task {
        try await streamVideo.rejectCall(callId: callId, callType: type)
    }
}
```
