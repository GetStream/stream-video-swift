title: Call & Participant State
description: How the state is exposed
---

### Video Call State

When you join a call, we'll automatically expose observable objects in 3 different places:

```swift
let clientState = streamVideo.state
let callState = call.state
let participants = call.state.participants
```

### Call State

The call state is kept in sync (updates are received) only when you join the call.

Here's an example of how you can access the call state:

```swift
let call = streamVideo.call(callType: "default", callId: "mycall")
let joinResult = try await call.join(create: true)
// state is now available at
let state = call.state
```

The following fields are available on the call:

| Attribute | Description|
| --------- | ---------- |
| `participants` | The list of call participants. |
| `localParticipant` | Shortcut to your own participant state. |
| `remoteParticipants` | The list of call participants other than yourself. |
| `activeSpeakers` | The list of participants who are currently speaking. |
| `dominantSpeaker` | The dominant speaker. |
| `members` | The list of call members. |
| `screenSharingSession` | If someone is screensharing, it will be available here. |
| `recordingState` | if the call is being recorded or not. |
| `blockedUserIds` | The user ids who are blocked from this call. |
| `settings` | The settings for this call. |
| `ownCapabilities` | Which actions you have permission to do. |

| `custom` | Custom data on the call. |
| `team` | Team that the call is restricted to. Default to null. |

| `transcribing` | a boolean indicating if transciptions are active or or not for this call. |
| `egress` | contains URL for playlist of recording. |
| `session` | the session associated with the call. |
| `reconnectionStatus` | whether the call is reconnecting. |
| `participantCount` | number of participants connected to the call. |
| `duration` | The duration of the call. |
| `statsReport` | Returns stats of the call, updated every 5 seconds. |

### Participant State

The `CallParticipant` is the most essential component used to render a participant in a call. It contains all of the information to render a participant, such as audio & video renderers, availabilities of audio & video, the screen sharing session, reactions, and etc. Here's how you iterate over the participants:

```swift
// all participants
let cancellable = call.state.$participants.sink { participants in
    // ..
}

// you
let localParticipant: CallParticipant? = call.state.localParticipant
```

The following fields are available on the participant:

| Attribute | Description|
| --------- | ---------- |
| `id` | The unique call id of the participant. |
| `userId` | The user's id. This is not necessarily unique, since a user can join from multiple devices. |
| `roles` | The user's roles in the call. |
| `name` | The user's name. |
| `profileImageURL`| The user's profile image url. |
| `trackLookupPrefix` | The id of the track that's connected to the participant. |
| `hasVideo` | Returns whether the participant has video. |
| `hasAudio` | Returns whether the participant has audio. |
| `isScreensharing` | Returns whether the participant is screenSharing. |
| `track` | Returns the participant's video track. |
| `trackSize` | Returns the size of the track for the participant. |
| `screenshareTrack` | Returns the screensharing track for the participant. |
| `showTrack` | Returns whether the track should be shown. |
| `isSpeaking` | Returns whether the participant is speaking. |
| `isDominantSpeaker` | Returns whether the participant is a dominant speaker. |
| `sessionId` | Returns whether the participant is speaking. |
| `connectionQuality` | The participant's connection quality. |
| `joinedAt` | Returns the date when the user joined the call. |
| `isPinned` | Returns whether the user is pinned. |
| `audioLevel` | The audio level for the user. |

### Client State

```swift
// client state is available on the client object
let state = streamVideo.state
```

And contains these fields:

| Attribute | Description|
| --------- | ---------- |
| `user` | The user you're currently authenticated as. |
| `connection` | The connection state. See ConnectionState. |
| `activeCall` | The call you've currently joined. |
| `ringingCall` | Contains the call if you're calling someone or someone is calling you. |
