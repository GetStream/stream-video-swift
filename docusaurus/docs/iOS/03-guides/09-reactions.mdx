## Sending Reactions

It's easy to add reactions to your call.

```swift
let response = try await call.sendReaction(type: "fireworks")
```

You can also add custom data to the reaction and specify a specific emoji

```swift
let response = try await call.sendReaction(
    type: "raise-hand",
    custom: ["mycustomfield": "hello"],
    emojiCode: ":smile:"
)
```

## Listening to Reactions

Here's an example that shows how to listen to reaction events:

```swift
for await event in call.subscribe(for: CallReactionEvent.self) {
    // handle reaction event
}
```
