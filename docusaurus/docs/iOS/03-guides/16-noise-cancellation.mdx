Noise Cancellation capabilities of our [iOS Video SDK](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/ios) can be enabled by installing our NoiseCancellation package. Under the hood, this package uses the technology developed by [krisp.ai](https://krisp.ai).

## Installation

### Add the SDK to your project

To add StreamVideo SDK, open Xcode and follow these steps:

- In Xcode, go to File -> "Add Packages..."
- Paste the URL https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-noise-cancellation-swift
- In the option "Dependency Rule" choose "Up to the Next Major Version," in the single text input next to it. The field will be populated automatically with the latest version.

- Choose "Add Package" and wait for the dialog to complete.
- Select `StreamVideoNoiseCancellation` and add it in your project.

### Integration

Our iOS SDK provides a utility component that make the integration smoother.

- `NoiseCancellationProcessor`: the object that comes from the `StreamVideoNoiseCancellation` and performs the noise cancellation operation.
- `NoiseCancellationFilter`: an object that conforms to `StreamVideo.AudioFilter` and perform all tasks requires for the noise cancellation session (e.g request start/stop).


```swift
// Firstly you initalize the processor.
let processor = NoiseCancellationProcessor()

// Secondly you instantiate the NoiseCancellationFilter. You can use any name, but it needs to be uniqueq compared to other AudioFilters you may be using.
let noiseCancellationFilter = NoiseCancellationFilter(
    name: "noise-cancellation",
    initialize: processor.initialize,
    process: processor.process,
    release: processor.release
)
```

Once you are able to create a `NoiseCancellationFilter` you can rely on `Call`'s API and state to toggle the filter status and also observe the features availability.

#### Feature availability

`Call.state.settings` contains the `noiseCancellation` configuration. The configuration contains a mode property that you look into, to determine the feature's availability:

- `.available`
The featue has been enabled on the dashboard and it's available for the call. In this case, you are free to present any noise cancellation toggle UI in your application.

- `.disabled`
The feature hasn't been enabled on the dashboard or the feature isn't available for the call. In this case, you should hide any noise cancellation toggle UI in your application.

- `.autoOn`
Similar to `.available` with the difference that if possible, the StreamVideo SDK will enabled the filter automatically, when the user join the useCallback.


#### Activate/Deactivate the filter

The `NoiseCancellationFilter` is an object conforming the `AudioFilter` protocol. That means, you can manage it in the same manner as any other audioFilter, as described [here](../../advanced/apply-video-filters).)

In order to support `.autoOn` though, the StreamVideo SDK requires us to provide it with a `NoiseCancellationFilter` instance. The instance you provide, will be used whenever the noise cancellation mode is `.autoOn`.

You can easily provide the `NoiseCancellationFilter` instance every time you initialize `StreamVideo`, like below:

```swift
// Create the NoiseCancellationFilter like the example above.

// Then you create VideoConfig instance that includes our NoiseCancellationFilter.
let videoConfig = VideoConfig(noiseCancellationFilter: noiseCancellationFilter)

// Finally, you create the StreamVideo instance by passing in our videoConfig.
let streamVideo = StreamVideo(
    apiKey: apiKey,
    user: user,
    token: token,
    videoConfig: videoConfig,
    tokenProvider: { _ in }
)
```
