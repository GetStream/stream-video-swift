When you create or join a call you get a list of call members, however this can return at most 25 members:

```swift
// The maximum limit is 25
// The default limit is 25
try await call.get(membersLimit: 25)
```

To get the complete list of call members the Stream API allows you to query, filter and sort members of a call using a paginated list.

## Examples

Below are a few examples of how to use this API:

```swift
// sorting and pagination
let sort = SortParamRequest(direction: 1, field: "user_id")
let result1 = try await call.queryMembers(
    sort: [sort],
    limit: 10
)

// loading the next page            
if let next = result1.next {
    let result2 = try await call.queryMembers(sort: [sort], limit: 10, next: next)
}
            
// filtering            
let result2 = try await call.queryMembers(
    filters: ["role": .dictionary(["eq": "admin"])]
)
```
