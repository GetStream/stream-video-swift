## Reactions

It's easy to add reactions to your call.

```swift
let response = try await call.sendReaction(type: "fireworks")
```

You can also add custom data to the reaction or specify a specific emoji

```swift
let response = try await call.sendReaction(type: "raise-hand", custom: ["mycustomfield": "hello"], emojiCode: "")
```

## Custom Events

In case the reaction system isn't flexible enough we also support custom events. This is basically just a realtime layer that you can broadcast your own events to.

```swift
let response = try await call.sendCustomEvent(["type": .string("draw"), "x": .number(10), "y": .number(20)])
```
