Noise Cancellation capabilities of our [iOS Video SDK](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/ios) can be enabled by installing our NoiseCancellation package. Under the hood, this package uses the technology developed by [krisp.ai](https://krisp.ai).

## Installation

### Add the SDK to your project

To add StreamVideo SDK, open Xcode and follow these steps:

- In Xcode, go to File -> "Add Packages..."
- Paste the URL https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-noise-cancellation-swift
- In the option "Dependency Rule" choose "Up to the Next Major Version," in the single text input next to it. The field will be populated automatically with the latest version.

- Choose "Add Package" and wait for the dialog to complete.
- Select `StreamVideoNoiseCancellation` and add it in your project.

### Integration

Our iOS SDK provides a utility component that makes the integration smoother.

- `NoiseCancellationProcessor`: the object that comes from the `StreamVideoNoiseCancellation` and performs the noise cancellation operation.
- `NoiseCancellationFilter`: an object that conforms to `StreamVideo.AudioFilter` and performs all tasks required for the noise cancellation session (e.g request start/stop).


```swift
// Firstly you initalize the processor.
let processor = NoiseCancellationProcessor()

// Secondly you instantiate the NoiseCancellationFilter. You can use any name, but it needs to be unique compared to other AudioFilters you may be using.
let noiseCancellationFilter = NoiseCancellationFilter(
    name: "noise-cancellation",
    initialize: processor.initialize,
    process: processor.process,
    release: processor.release
)
```

Once you are able to create a `NoiseCancellationFilter` you can rely on `Call`'s API and state to toggle the filter status and also observe the features availability.

#### Feature availability

`Call.state.settings` contains the `noiseCancellation` configuration. The configuration contains a mode property that you look into, to determine the feature's availability:

- `.available`
The featue has been enabled on the dashboard and it's available for the call. In this case, you are free to present any noise cancellation toggle UI in your application.

:::important
Even though the feature may be enabled for your call, you should note that NoiseCancellation is a very performance-heavy process. For that reason, it's recommended to only allow the feature on devices that support Apple's neuralEngine. 

You can easily check if the current device has neuralEngine support by using `StreamVideo.isHardwareAccelerationAvailable` on your streamVideo initialized instance.

For more info you can refer to our [UI docs](../../ui-cookbook/noise-cancellation). about Noise Cancellation.
:::

- `.disabled`
The feature hasn't been enabled on the dashboard or the feature isn't available for the call. In this case, you should hide any noise cancellation toggle UI in your application.

- `.autoOn`
Similar to `.available` with the difference that if possible, the StreamVideo SDK will enable the filter automatically, when the user join the call.

:::note
The requirements for `.autoOn` to work properly are:
- A `VideoConfig.noiseCancellationFilter` value when you initialise StreamVideo
- Device has support for Apple's neuralEngine
:::

#### Activate/Deactivate the filter

The `NoiseCancellationFilter` is an object conforming to the `AudioFilter` protocol. That means, you can manage it in the same manner as any other audioFilter, as described [here](../../advanced/apply-video-filters).)

In order to support `.autoOn` though, the StreamVideo SDK requires us to provide it with a `NoiseCancellationFilter` instance. The instance you provide, will be used whenever the noise cancellation mode is `.autoOn`.

You can easily provide the `NoiseCancellationFilter` instance every time you initialize `StreamVideo`, like below:

```swift
// Create the NoiseCancellationFilter like the example above.

// Then you create VideoConfig instance that includes our NoiseCancellationFilter.
let videoConfig = VideoConfig(noiseCancellationFilter: noiseCancellationFilter)

// Finally, you create the StreamVideo instance by passing in our videoConfig.
let streamVideo = StreamVideo(
    apiKey: apiKey,
    user: user,
    token: token,
    videoConfig: videoConfig,
    tokenProvider: { _ in }
)
```
