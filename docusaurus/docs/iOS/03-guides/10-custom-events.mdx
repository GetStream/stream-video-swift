## Sending Custom Events

In case the reaction system isn't flexible enough we also support custom events.

You can use custom events to send data between participants in the call. This is a realtime layer that you can broadcast your own events to.

For example, if you are building a collaborative drawing app, you can send the coordinates to the other participants with the following code:

```swift
let response = try await call.sendCustomEvent(["type": .string("draw"), "x": .number(10), "y": .number(20)])
```

The data that can be passed with a custom event has a limit of 100KB. 

If you want to pass larger files:
- you can send URLs to those resources and download them from your location when the event is received.
- you can split the file into chunks of bytes and send them with separate events.
- if you are sending an image, you can resize it before you pass it in the event.

Here's an example that shows how to resize an image and send it as a base 64 encoded string via custom event:

```swift
func sendImageData(_ data: Data) async {
    guard
        let snapshot = UIImage(data: data),
        let resizedImage = resize(image: snapshot, to: .init(width: 30, height: 30)),
        let snapshotData = resizedImage.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8)
    else {
        return
    }

    do {
        try await call?.sendCustomEvent([
            "snapshot": .string(snapshotData.base64EncodedString())
        ])
    } catch {
        log.error("Failed to send image.", error: error)
    }
}

private func resize(
    image: UIImage,
    to targetSize: CGSize
) -> UIImage? {
    guard
        image.size.width > targetSize.width || image.size.height > targetSize.height
    else {
        return image
    }

    let widthRatio = targetSize.width / image.size.width
    let heightRatio = targetSize.height / image.size.height

    // Determine the scale factor that preserves aspect ratio
    let scaleFactor = min(widthRatio, heightRatio)

    let scaledWidth = image.size.width * scaleFactor
    let scaledHeight = image.size.height * scaleFactor
    let targetRect = CGRect(
        x: (targetSize.width - scaledWidth) / 2,
        y: (targetSize.height - scaledHeight) / 2,
        width: scaledWidth,
        height: scaledHeight
    )

    // Create a new image context
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(targetSize, false, 0)
    image.draw(in: targetRect)

    let newImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext()

    return newImage
}
```

## Listening to Custom Events

Custom events are only delivered to clients that are watching the call.

To receive custom events, you need to subscribe to the custom WebSocket event.

```swift
for await event in call.subscribe(for: CustomVideoEvent.self) {
    // read custom data
    let customData = event.custom
    // perform actions with the custom data.
}
```

The custom event has the following properties:

- `callCid`: `String` - the type and call id that identifies the call
- `createdAt`: `Date` - when was the event created
- `custom`: `[String: RawJSON]` - any custom data you send via the `sendCustomEvent` method
- `user`: `UserResponse` - the user who sent the event
