# SDK Size Impact

When developing a mobile app, one crucial performance metric is app size. An app’s size can be difficult to accurately measure with multiple variants and device spreads. Once measured, it’s even more difficult to understand and identify what’s contributing to size bloat.

We track and update the SDK size on every commit to our `develop` branch. The sizes of all SDKs that are part of our video product are shown with badges, at the top of our GitHub [repo](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-swift). 

Therefore, please check our repo to get the up-to date sizes of our video SDKs.
