---

The `Call` object provides several options to ring and notify users about a call. 

### Ringing

If a call was not created before, you should first create it and pass the ring value to `true`. For this, you can use the `create` method from the `Call` object.

```swift
let call = streamVideo.call(callType: "default", callId: callId)
let callResponse = try await call.create(members: members, ring: true)
```

When `ring` is true, a VoIP notification will be sent to the members, provided you have the required setup for CallKit and PushKit. If you don't have a VoIP push setup, a regular push notification will be sent to the members. For more details around push notifications, please check [this page](../push-notifications).

If `ring` is false, no push notification will be sent.

If a call was created before, the method will just get it and send the notifications. If you are sure that a call exists, you can use the `get` method instead:

```swift
let call = streamVideo.call(callType: "default", callId: callId)
let callResponse = try await call.get(ring: true)
```

Additionally, you can use the `ring` method which is just a shortcut for the method above:

```swift
let call = streamVideo.call(callType: "default", callId: callId)
let callResponse = try await call.ring()
```

### Notifying users

In some cases, you just want to notify users that you joined a call, instead of ringing. To do this, you should use the `notify` option:

```swift
let call = streamVideo.call(callType: "default", callId: callId)
let callResponse = try await call.create(members: members, notify: true)
```

When `notify` is true, a regular push notification will be sent to all the members. This can be useful for livestreams apps or huddles. 

Similarly to ringing, you can use the `get` method if you are sure that the call exists:

```swift
let call = streamVideo.call(callType: "default", callId: callId)
let callResponse = try await call.get(notify: true)
```

You can also use a shortcut of this method, with the `notify` method:

```swift
let call = streamVideo.call(callType: "default", callId: callId)
let callResponse = try await call.notify()
```

### AutoLeave Policy

There may be scenarios where once a call is concluded there is no point for a user to remain in the call if the other participants have already left. In cases like that you may find youself in a position where you need to last participant to automatically leave the call. Luckily, the StreamVideoSwiftUI SDK makes that very easy by allowing you to set the `ParticipantAutoLeavePolicy`, like below:

```swift
let callViewModel = CallViewModel()
callViewModel.participantAutoLeavePolicy = LastParticipantAutoLeavePolicy()
```

By doing that, we are instructing the `CallViewModel` to observe the participants during the ringing flow call (incoming or outgoing). Once a user remain the last one, the callViewModel will automatically trigger the flow to leave the call.

:::note
The `participantAutoLeavePolicy` is set to `DefaultParticipantAutoLeavePolicy` which is a no-operation policy, meaning that if the user remain in the call alone, no automatic action will be performed.
