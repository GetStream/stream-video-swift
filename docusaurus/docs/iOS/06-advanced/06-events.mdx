In most cases, you should rely on the `StreamVideo` or `CallViewModel` and its events for building and updating your UI. However for some customizations you'll want to listen to the underlying events that power these objects.

## Listening to events
Both the call and streamVideo object allow you to subscribe to events. You can listen to a specific event or all of them. This example shows how to listen to all events.

```swift
Task {
    for await event in streamVideo.subscribe() {
        print(event)
    }
}
```

You can also subscribe for a specific call.
```swift
Task {
    let call = streamVideo.call("default", "123")
    for await event in call.subscribe() {
        print(event)
    }
}
```

:::note
When subscribing to all events either on the client or a call, you will be receiving events of type `VideoEvent`. `VideoEvent` is the discriminator object for all websocket events, you should use this to map event payloads to their own type.

```swift
Task {
    let call = streamVideo.call("default", "123")
    for await event in call.subscribe() {
        switch event {
        case .typeBlockedUserEvent(let blockedUserEvent):
            print(blockedUserEvent)
        case .typeCallAcceptedEvent(let callAcceptedEvent):
            print(callAcceptedEvent)
        default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```
:::

Or listen to a specific event
```swift
Task {
    let call = streamVideo.call("default", "123")
    for await event in call.subscribe(for: ConnectedEvent.self) {
        print(event)
    }
}
```

## Events
