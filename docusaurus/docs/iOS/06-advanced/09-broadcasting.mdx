The StreamVideo SDK has support for broadcasting calls. You can find a tutorial on how to implement broadcasting calls in our [livestreaming tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/ios/tutorial/livestreaming/).

### Creating a call

First, you need to create a call with a user that has the capability to start broadcasting calls (`start-broadcast-call`).

```swift
let call = streamVideo.call(callType: .default, callId: callId)
Task {
    try await call.join()
}
```

The code above will create and join the call. If you just want to create it (and not join it), you can use the method `create`:

```swift
let call = try await call.create(members: members, startsAt: Date(), custom: [:], ring: false)
```

### Start HLS

You can start HLS broadcasting a call, by calling the method `startHLS`:

```swift
try await call.startHLS()
```

After few seconds of setup, the call would be broadcasted, and you will receive an event called `BroadcastingStartedEvent`. Also, the `state` of the call would be updated - the `broadcasting` value would become true.

You can listen to the broadcasting events on the call by subscribing to its `AsyncStream`:

```swift
for await event in call.subscribe() {
    switch event {
        case .typeCallBroadcastingStartedEvent(let broadcastingStartedEvent):
            log.debug("received an event \(broadcastingStartedEvent)")
            /* handle recording event */
        case .typeCallBroadcastingStoppedEvent(let broadcastingStoppedEvent):
            log.debug("received an event \(broadcastingStoppedEvent)")
            /* handle recording event */
        default:
            break
    }
}
```

In the `BroadcastingStartedEvent`, you will receive the `hlsPlaylistUrl`, a URL that can be used by other participants to watch the broadcasting.

### Stop HLS

When you are done with broadcasting, you should call the method `stopHLS`.

```swift
try await call.stopHLS()
```

This action will also send `BroadcastingStoppedEvent` to all participants who are watching the call.
