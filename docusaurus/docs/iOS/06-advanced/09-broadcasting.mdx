The StreamVideo SDK has support for broadcasting calls. You can find a tutorial on how to implement broadcasting calls in our [livestreaming tutorial](../../tutorials/livestream).

### Creating a call

First, you need to create a call with a user that has the capability to start broadcasting calls (`start-broadcast-call`).

```swift
let call = streamVideo.makeCall(callType: .default, callId: callId, members: [currentUser])
Task {
    try await call.join()
}
```

The code above will create and join the call. If you just want to create it (and not join it), you can use the method `getOrCreateCall`:

```swift
let call = try await call.getOrCreate(members: members, startsAt: Date(), customData: [:], membersLimit: 100, ring: false)    
```

### Start broadcasting

You can start broadcasting a call, by calling the method `startBroadcasting`:

```swift
try await call.startBroadcasting()
```

After few seconds of setup, the call would be broadcasted, and you will receive an event called `BroadcastingStartedEvent`. Also, the `state` of the call would be updated - the `broadcasting` value would become true.

You can listen to the broadcasting events on the call by subscribing to its `AsyncStream`:

```swift
for await event in call.broadcastingEvents() {
    print(event)
}
```

In the `BroadcastingStartedEvent`, you will receive the `hlsPlaylistUrl`, a URL that can be used by other participants to watch the broadcasting.

### Stop broadcasting

When you are done with broadcasting, you should call the method `stopBroadcasting`.

```swift
try await call.stopBroadcasting()
```

This action will also send `BroadcastingStoppedEvent` to all participants who are watching the call.
