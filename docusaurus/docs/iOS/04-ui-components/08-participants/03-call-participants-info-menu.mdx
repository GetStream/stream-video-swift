# CallParticipantsInfoView

The `CallParticipantsInfoView` component represents a popup that lets the user see more information about a particular call and its participants. It allows you to see which participants are in the call, what their mute state is and attempt to trigger different actions based on your own capabilities.

On top of that, the menu allows you to invite other people to the call.

Let's see how to use the component.

## Usage

If you want to use the componant as a standalone, you can create it like this:

```swift
let view = CallParticipantsInfoView(callViewModel: viewModel, availableFrame: availableFrame)
```

The required parameters for this method are:
- `callViewModel` - the call view model used for the call.
- `availableFrame` - the available frame for the view.

Additionally, if you are using our `ViewFactory` and the default view, you can customize or swap this view with your own implementation. In order to do that, you should implement the method `makeParticipantsListView`:

```swift
func makeParticipantsListView(
    viewModel: CallViewModel,
    availableFrame: CGRect
) -> some View {
    CustomCallParticipantsInfoView(
        callViewModel: viewModel, 
        availableFrame: availableFrame
    )
}
```

The component also provides a view that you can use to invite members to the call. You can provide your own list of users that should be browsable in the view. In order to do that, you should implement the `UserListProvider` protocol.

The protocol has one method loadNextUsers(pagination: Pagination), that returns a list of users:

```swift
func loadNextUsers(pagination: Pagination) async throws -> [User] {
    // load the users, based on the pagination parameter provided
}
``` 

The `Pagination` model consists of the following properties:
- `pageSize` - the size of the page
- `offset` - the current pagination offset

In order to inject your custom implementation, you need to provide it in the creation of the `Utils` class:

```swift
let utils = Utils(userListProvider: MockUserListProvider())
let streamVideoUI = StreamVideoUI(streamVideo: streamVideo, utils: utils)
```
