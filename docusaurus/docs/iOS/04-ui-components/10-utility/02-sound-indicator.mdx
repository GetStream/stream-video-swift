# SoundIndicator

If you're looking to build a way for users to know if a person is muted or unmuted, you can use our `SoundIndicator` component.

It's very simple and represents a few states:

* **Muted**: shows a muted microphone icon to indicate that the user has turned off their audio.
* **Unmuted**: shows a regular microphone icon to indicate that the user has turned their microphone on.

## Usage

To add the SoundIndicator component to your layout, you can use the `SoundIndicator` view like this:

```swift
SoundIndicator(participant: participant)
```

The `participant` is of type `CallParticipant` and it represents one participant in the call. 

The view is very simple and it allows only changing its microphone icons.

To do that, you need to provide your own values in the `Images` class and inject it in the `Appearance` object:

```swift
let images = Images()
images.micTurnOn = Image("custom_mic_turn_on_icon")
images.micTurnOff = Image("custom_mic_turn_off_icon")
let appearance = Appearance(images: images)
streamVideoUI = StreamVideoUI(streamVideo: streamVideo, appearance: appearance)
```
