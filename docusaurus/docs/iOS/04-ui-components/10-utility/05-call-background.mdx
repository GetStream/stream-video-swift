# CallBackground

The `CallBackground` component is used as a background for the incoming and outgoing call screens. It can present both the participant that's being called (or calling you), or a fallback background if this information is not available.

Let's see how to use the component.

## Usage

To use the `CallBackground`, you can simply embed it somewhere in your custom UI, like this:

```swift
var body: some View {
    YourView()
        .background(CallBackground(imageURL: imageURL))
}
```

If there is one participant in the call, the person who's calling you, or the person you're calling, their respective profile image would be rendered, provided the user has an image url.

If the optional `imageURL` is nil, the default fallback background would be displayed, which is a dark `LinearGradient`.
