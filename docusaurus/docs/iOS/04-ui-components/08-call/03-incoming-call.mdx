# IncomingCallView

The `IncomingCallView` lets you easily build UI when you're being called or ringed by other people in an app. It's used to show more information about the participants and the call itself, as well as give you the option to reject or accept the call. 

## Usage

In order to create the `IncomingCallView`, you need to instantiate it with the following code:

```swift
public var body: some View {
	IncomingCallView(
	   callInfo: callInfo, 
	   onCallAccepted: { _ in
		// handle call accepted
       }, onCallRejected: { _ in
    	// handle call rejected
       }
    )
}
```

If you are using our `CallContainer` to add calling support to your views, this view is automatically shown when the `callingState` in the `CallViewModel` is `.incoming`.

If you want to customize (or completely replace) the `IncomingCallView`, you should use the `ViewFactory` method `makeIncomingCallView`:

```swift
public func makeIncomingCallView(viewModel: CallViewModel, callInfo: IncomingCall) -> some View {
    CustomIncomingCallView(viewModel: viewModel, callInfo: callInfo)
}
```

## Sounds

By default, the outgoing call view plays ringing sound when the ringing is in progress. If you want to change the sounds, you should provide your own instance of the `Sounds` class in the `Appearance` object, while replacing the `incomingCallSound` with your own sound file.

```swift
let sounds = Sounds()
sounds.incomingCallSound = "your_sounds.m4a"
let appearance = Appearance(sounds: sounds)
streamVideoUI = StreamVideoUI(streamVideo: streamVideo, appearance: appearance)
```

## Localization and icons

You can change the texts and the icons in the `IncomingCallView`. For more details about changing the texts, please check the localization [guide](../../../advanced/text-localization).

In order to change the icons, you need to create your own version of the `Images` class and change the icons you want to customize.

For example, if we want to change the `hangup` icon, we can do the following:

```swift
let images = Images()
images.hangup = Image("custom_hangup_icon")
let appearance = Appearance(images: images)
streamVideoUI = StreamVideoUI(streamVideo: streamVideo, appearance: appearance)
```
