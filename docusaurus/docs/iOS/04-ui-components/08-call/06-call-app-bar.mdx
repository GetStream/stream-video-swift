# CallTopView

The `CallTopView` represents the component displayed at the top of the `CallView`. By default, it contains a button to minimize the call (on the leading side), a layout menu (for changing different call participant layouts) and a button that can show the call participants list (on the trailing side).

Let's see how to use the component.

## Usage

To instantiate the `CallTopView`, you just need to provide the `CallViewModel`:

```swift
var body: some View {
    CallTopView(viewModel: viewModel)
}
```

If you want to customize (or completely replace) the `CallTopView`, you should use the `ViewFactory` method `makeCallTopView`:

```swift
public func makeCallTopView(viewModel: CallViewModel) -> some View {
    CustomCallTopView(viewModel: viewModel)
}
```

### Changing layouts

The default `CallTopView` contains a layout menu selection view, which can change the `participantsLayout` in the `CallViewModel`. The `participantsLayout` is an enum, with the following cases:
- `grid` - the participants are shown in a grid
- `spotlight` - one participants is shown in a spotlight, while the others are in a horizontal list below
- `fullScreen` - only one participant is shown
