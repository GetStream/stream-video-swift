# CallView

The `CallView` lets you easily build UI when inside a call. It handles the state and actions of enabling and disabling audio, front/back camera or video, as well as information about the call participtants. 

## Usage

In order to create a `CallView`, you should provide a `ViewFactory` and a `CallViewModel`:

```swift
public var body: some View {
    CallView(viewFactory: DefaultViewFactory.shared, viewModel: viewModel)
}
```

If you are using our `CallView` to add calling support to your views, this view is automatically shown when the `callingState` in the `CallViewModel` is `.inCall`.

If you want to customize (or completely replace) the `CallView`, you should use the `ViewFactory` method `makeCallView`:

```swift
public func makeCallView(viewModel: CallViewModel) -> some View {
    CustomCallView(viewFactory: self, viewModel: viewModel)
}
```

### CallView components

By using your own implementation of the `ViewFactory`, you can swap parts of the `CallView` with your own implementation. 

#### Call Controls View

The call controls view by default displays controls for hiding/showing the camera, muting/unmuting the microphone, changing the camera source (front/back) and hanging up. If you want to change these controls, you will need to implement the `makeCallControlsView(viewModel: CallViewModel) -> some View` method:

```swift
func makeCallControlsView(viewModel: CallViewModel) -> some View {
    CustomCallControlsView(viewModel: viewModel)
}
```

#### Video Participants View

The video participants view slot presents the grid of users that are in the call. If you want to provide a different variation of the participants display, you will need to implement the `makeVideoParticipantsView` in the `ViewFactory`:

```swift
public func makeVideoParticipantsView(
    participants: [CallParticipant],
    availableFrame: CGRect,
    onChangeTrackVisibility: @escaping @MainActor(CallParticipant, Bool) -> Void
) -> some View {
    VideoParticipantsView(
        participants: participants,
        availableFrame: availableFrame,
        onChangeTrackVisibility: onChangeTrackVisibility
    )
}
```

In the method, the following parameters are provided:

- `participants` - the list of participants.
- `availableFrame` - the available frame for the participants view.
- `onChangeTrackVisibility` - callback when the track changes its visibility.

#### Video Participant View

If you want to customize one particular participant view, you can change it via the method `makeVideoParticipantView`:

```swift
public func makeVideoParticipantView(
    participant: CallParticipant,
    id: String,
    availableFrame: CGRect,
    contentMode: UIView.ContentMode,
    customData: [String: RawJSON],
    call: Call?
) -> some View {
    VideoCallParticipantView(
        participant: participant,
        id: id,
        availableFrame: availableFrame,
        contentMode: contentMode,
        call: call
    )
}
```

Additionally, you can change the modifier applied to the view, by implementing the `makeVideoCallParticipantModifier`:

```swift
public func makeVideoCallParticipantModifier(
        participant: CallParticipant,
        call: Call?,
        availableFrame: CGRect,
        ratio: CGFloat,
        showAllInfo: Bool
) -> some ViewModifier {
    VideoCallParticipantModifier(
        participant: participant,
        call: call,
        availableFrame: availableFrame,
        ratio: ratio,
        showAllInfo: showAllInfo
    )
}
```

#### Top View

This is the view presented in the top area of the call view. By default, it displays a back button (to go in minimized mode) and a button that shows the list of participants. You can swap this view with your own implementation, by implementing the `makeCallTopView` in the `ViewFactory`:

```swift
public func makeCallTopView(viewModel: CallViewModel) -> some View {
    CallTopView(viewModel: viewModel)
}
```
