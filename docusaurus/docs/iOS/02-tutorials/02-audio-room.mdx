## Audio Room Tutorial

This tutorial will teach you how to build an audio room experience like Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse.

- Backstage mode. You can start the call with your co-hosts and chat a bit before going live
- Calls run on Stream's global edge network for optimal latency and scalability
- There is no cap to how many listeners you can have in a room
- Listeners can raise their hand, and be invited to speak by the host
- Audio tracks are send multiple times for optimal reliability
- Time to get started

### Step 1 - Create a new project in Xcode
| Create a new Project in Xcode | Select iOS as the platform and then select app as the type. | Name your project "AudioRooms" and select SwiftUI as your UI setup. |
|---|---|---|

### Step 2 - Install the SDK & Setup the client
#### Add the SwiftUI SDK as dependency to your Xcode Project.

| Open Project's settings | Add the package's URL (https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-swift) in the search bar | Add the following SDK to your target |

```swift
import SwiftUI
import StreamVideo

@main
struct AudioRoomsApp: App {
    @State var call: Call?
    private let currentUser: User
    private var streamVideo: StreamVideo?

    init() {
        // create a user.
        self.currentUser = User(
            id: "tutorial@getstream.io", // The User Id can be found in the Credentials section
            name: "Tutorial", // The name is used in the UI
            role: "admin" // user roles are important for an audio room
        )

        // initialize StreamVideo
        self.streamVideo = StreamVideo(
            apiKey: "hd8szvscpxvd", // The API Key can be found in the Credentials section
            user: currentUser,
            token: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoidHV0b3JpYWxAZ2V0c3RyZWFtLmlvIiwiaXNzIjoicHJvbnRvIiwic3ViIjoidXNlci90dXRvcmlhbEBnZXRzdHJlYW0uaW8iLCJpYXQiOjE2ODY3NDY4MDksImV4cCI6MTY4NzM1MTYxNH0.j14I3udGgr_pfkS0_Jz8s7xR7gRzitP58fjTjLkbnk8" // The token can be found in the Credentials section
        )
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            Group {
                if let call = call {
                    Text("Call \(call.callId) has \(call.state.participantCount) participants")
                        .font(.system(size: 30))
                        .foregroundColor(.blue)
                } else {
                    Text("loading...")
                }
            }.task {
                Task {
                    guard call == nil else { return }
                    try await streamVideo?.connect()
                    call = streamVideo?.call(callType: .audioRoom, callId: "123") // The callId can be found in the Credentials section
                    try await call?.join()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By default calls of type "audio_room" start with backstage mode enabled. Admins and moderators can join the call. Regular users can only join the call when you go live. This gives an opportunity to setup the audio/video etc before inviting people in.


### Step 3 - Adding audio room UI elements
In this next step we'll add:

- Room title, room description
- A list of participants
- An indicator for who's speaking

Let's create a component for the active speaker and the list of participants.
```swift
struct ParticipantView: View {

    var participant: CallParticipant

    init(participant: CallParticipant) {
        self.participant = participant
    }

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Text("\(participant.name) - \(participant.roles.joined(separator: ","))")
                .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .leading)

            if participant.isSpeaking {
                Circle()
                    .fill(Color.blue)
                    .frame(width: 15, height: 15)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Next we'll create 
```swift
Group {
   if let call = call {
      VStack {
         Text("Room: \(call.state.callData?.customData["title"]?.stringValue ?? "") - \(participants.count) - id \(call.callId)")
         Text("\(call.state.callData?.customData["description"]?.stringValue ?? "")")
         List(participants) { participant in
               ParticipantView(participant: participant)
         }
         Button {
               Task {
                  try await call.goLive()
               }
         } label: {
               Text("Go Live")
                  .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
         }
         .padding([.leading, .trailing])
         .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
      }
      .onReceive(call.state.$participants) {
         self.participants = Array($0.values).sorted(by: { $0.name < $1.name })
      }
   } else {
      Text("loading...")
   }
}
```

### Step 4 - Go live and join from the browser

Run the sample app now and you'll see 1 participant. Click the go live button to allow participants to join.

To make this a little more interactive let's join the call from your browser. Visit https://getstream.io/video/demos/?id=123&skip-intro=1 and join the call. On your iOS emulator you'll see the text update to 2 participants.

Note how the web interface won't allow you to share your audio/video. The reason for this is that by default the audio_room call type only allows moderators or admins to speak. Regular participants can request permission. And if different defaults make sense for your app you can edit the call type in the dashboard or create your own.


### Step 5 - Requesting permission to speak
Requesting permission to speak is easy.
```swift
let response = try await call.request(permissions: [.sendAudio])

// and next the admin will call
val requests = call.state.permissionRequests.value
for await request in call.subscribe(for: PermissionRequestEvent.self) {
      call.grant(permissions: [.sendAudio], for: request.user.id)
}
```

## Other built-in features
There are a few more exciting features that you can use to build audio rooms

**Query Calls** You can query calls to easily show upcoming calls, calls that recently finished etc. **Reactions & Custom events** Reactions and custom events are supported. **Recording & Broadcasting** You can record your calls Chat Stream's chat SDKs are fully featured and you can integrate them in the call **Moderation** Moderation capabilities are built-in to the product **Transcriptions** Transcriptions aren't available yet, but they are due to launch soon

## Recap
It was fun to see just how quickly you can build an audio-room for your app. Please do let us know if you ran into any issues. Our team is also happy to review your UI designs and offer recommendations on how to achieve it with Stream.

To recap what we've learned:

- You setup a call: (call = streamVideo?.call(callType: .audioRoom, callId: "123"))
- The call type "audio_room" controls which features are enabled and how permissions are setup
- The audio_room by default enables "backstage" mode, and only allows admins to join before the call goes live
- When you join a call, realtime communication is setup for audio & video calling: (call.join())
- State objects in call.state and call.state.participants make it easy to build your own UI
- Calls run on Stream's global edge network of video servers. Being closer to your users improves the latency and reliability of calls. For audio rooms we use Opus RED and Opus DTX for optimal audio quality.

The SDKs enable you to build audio rooms, video calling and livestreaming in days.
