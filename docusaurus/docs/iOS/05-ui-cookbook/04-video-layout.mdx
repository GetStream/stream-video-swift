### Introduction

There are many different variations for building the user interface of a video calling app. The `StreamVideo` iOS SDK provides many different ways and flexibility to build your custom UI. Depending on your use-case, you can either reuse our lower-level UI components, or build completely custom ones, while making use of our video client and state handling.

### The sample app

In this tutorial, we will build a video calling app without using our UI SDKs. The goal would be to show you how to use our `StreamVideo` client and the `CallViewModel`, as well as how to build your custom UI components.

Here's a screenshot of what we are going to build:

### Prerequisites

This tutorial focuses solely on building a custom UI without going through the setup of our `StreamVideo` client, or authenticating users. Make sure to check our [sample project](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-ios-examples/tree/main/UICookbook) and perform the required setup.

### Starting a call

In order to start a call, you will need to know the call's id. Let's add a simple UI that will allow the users to enter the call id:

```swift
struct JoinCallView: View {

    @State var callId = ""
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: CallViewModel

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Insert call id", text: $callId)
            Button {
                resignFirstResponder()
                viewModel.startCall(callId: callId, type: .default, members: [])
            } label: {
                Text("Join call")
            }
            Spacer()
        }
        .padding()
    }

}
```

Note the `viewModel.startCall` method, which is called on a tap of the "Join call" button. This starts a call with the provided call id. Adding participants is optional - if the call type is `default`, anyone can join the call.

### Listening to the calling state

Next, let's use this view in a container view, called `HomeView`, that will also present our calling screen.

```swift
struct HomeView: View {

    @ObservedObject var appState: AppState

    @StateObject var viewModel = CallViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            JoinCallView(viewModel: viewModel)

            if viewModel.callingState == .joining {
                ProgressView()
            } else if viewModel.callingState == .inCall {
                CallView(viewModel: viewModel)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this view, we are creating the `CallViewModel`, that allows us to start a call, but also listen to the `callingState`. We can use this `@Published` variable to update our UI accordingly.

When the call is in the `.joining` state, we can show a `ProgressView`. Whenever it changes to the `.inCall` state (which means the user has joined the call), we can show our custom `CallView`.

### Building a custom CallView

Next, let's build our custom `CallView`, which would have a different UI than the default UI SDK implementation. Our goal here would be to show a large video of the current speaker, while the other users' avatars are presented at the bottom, in a horizontally scrollable list.

First, let's see how we can access the participants.

```swift
var participants: [CallParticipant] {
    viewModel
        .callParticipants.map(\.value)
        .sorted(using: defaultComparators)
}
```

The call participants are exposed via the `CallViewModel`'s `callParticipants` dictionary. You can sort them or group them based on their different properties, such as whether they are speaking, they have audio / video or any other different criteria. The `callParticipants` dictionary is a `@Published` variable, and it will trigger updates in your views, whenever its state changes.

There are default sort comparators, that you can use to sort the participants. The default comparators prioritize the pinned user, then the dominant speaker etc:

```swift
public let defaultComparators: [Comparator<CallParticipant>] = [
    pinned, screensharing, dominantSpeaker, publishingVideo, publishingAudio, userId
]
```

You can provide your own ordering by calling the `sorted(using: comparators)` method on the `CallParticipants`.

Additionally, you can access the same properties for the local user, via the `CallViewModel`'s `localParticipant` variable.

Next, let's see the implementation of the `CallView`'s `body`:

```swift
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        ZStack {
            GeometryReader { reader in
                if let dominantSpeaker = participants.first {
                    VideoCallParticipantView(
                        participant: dominantSpeaker,
                        availableFrame: reader.frame(in: .global),
                        contentMode: .scaleAspectFit,
                        call: call
                    )
                }

                VStack {
                    Spacer()
                    CustomCallControlsView(viewModel: viewModel)
                }
            }
        }
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
        .cornerRadius(32)
        .padding(.bottom)
        .padding(.horizontal)

        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            HStack {
                ForEach(participants.dropFirst()) { participant in
                    BottomParticipantView(participant: participant)
                }
            }
        }
        .padding(.all, 32)
        .frame(height: 100)
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
    }
    .background(Color.black)
}
```

Our main container would be a `VStack`, that consists of two parts - the dominant speaker view and the scrollable participant list.
Additionally, the dominant speaker view also shows the call controls for the current user, which means we can use a `ZStack`.

#### Dominant speaker view

The dominant speaker is presented using the SDKs `VideoCallParticipantView`, which handles showing both the video feed of the user, or their profile image if the video is disabled. If you want a different behaviour or UI here, you can also use the lower-level component `VideoRendererView`, that shows the video feed of the participant, and add your additional custom UI elements.

#### Custom call controls view

Next, let's see the `CustomCallControlsView`:

```swift
struct CustomCallControlsView: View {

    @ObservedObject var viewModel: CallViewModel

    var body: some View {
        HStack(spacing: 32) {
            VideoIconView(viewModel: viewModel)
            MicrophoneIconView(viewModel: viewModel)
            ToggleCameraIconView(viewModel: viewModel)
            HangUpIconView(viewModel: viewModel)
        }
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .frame(height: 85)
    }
}
```

In this example, we are building a custom call controls view, using buttons from the SDK, for muting video/audio, toggling camera and hanging up. You can easily add your own UI elements in the `HStack` above. You can use the `CallViewModel` for the standard call-related actions, or use the `Call` object directly for custom events and reactions (as described [here](../../advanced/events)), and for permissions related actions (as described [here](../../guides/permissions-and-moderation)).

#### Horizontally scrollable list

Finally, let's see the horizontally scrollable list at the bottom again:

```swift
ScrollView(.horizontal) {
    HStack {
        ForEach(participants.dropFirst()) { participant in
            BottomParticipantView(participant: participant)
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we drop the first element (that's displayed in the dominant speaker view) from the participants array. This components displays a custom view of type `BottomParticipantView`:

```swift
struct BottomParticipantView: View {

    var participant: CallParticipant

    var body: some View {
        UserAvatar(imageURL: participant.profileImageURL, size: 80)
            .overlay(
                !participant.hasAudio ?
                    BottomRightView {
                        MuteIndicatorView()
                    }
                : nil
            )
    }

}
```

This is a simple view that makes use of our `UserAvatar` view for displaying the user's profile image. It also shows an overlay for the mute indicator, which in this case is a custom UI element:

```swift
struct MuteIndicatorView: View {

    var body: some View {
        Image(systemName: "mic.slash.fill")
            .resizable()
            .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
            .frame(width: 14)
            .padding(.all, 12)
            .foregroundColor(.gray)
            .background(Color.black)
            .clipShape(Circle())
            .offset(x: 4, y: 8)
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

That's everything that needs to be done to have the UI shown in the screenshot above. Since everything we build was with custom components, you can further change and re-arrange it to fit your use-case.
