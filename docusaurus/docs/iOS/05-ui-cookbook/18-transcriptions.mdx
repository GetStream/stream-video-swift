# Transcriptions

Enabling your application to provide a transcript for a call can be very useful for you users. We understand though, that this can be a difficult feature to implement/support.

This is why, the StreamVideo SDK comes with out of the box Transcription support that you can easily manage. 

The fo `Call` object provides 2 levels of control. The first one is in the `Call.state.settings.transcription` where you can find settings related to transcription, as they have been configured from the dashboard. The `mode` property defines the feature's availability with :
- `available`: the feature is available for your call and can be enabled.
- `disabled`: the feature is not available for your call. In this case, it's a good idea to "hide" any UI element you have related to transcription.
- `autoOn`: the feature is available and it will be enabled automatically, once the user is connected on the call. 

The second level of control is the `Call.state.transcribing` which allows you to check if the transcription is enabled at any given time.

With that in mind, we can build a simple UI element that will allow the user to toggle on/off the Transcription feature. The element will also take care of showing/hiding depending on the feature's availability.

```swift
struct TranscriptionButtonView: View {

    @ObservedObject var viewModel: CallViewModel
    @State private var isTranscriptionAvailable = false
    @State private var isTranscribing = false

    init(viewModel: CallViewModel) {
        self.viewModel = viewModel
        if let mode = viewModel.call?.state.settings?.transcription.mode {
            self.isTranscriptionAvailable = mode != .disabled
        } else {
            self.isTranscriptionAvailable = false    
        }
        self.isTranscribing = viewModel.call?.state.transcribing == true
    }

    var body: some View {
        if let call = viewModel.call {
            Group {
                if isTranscriptionAvailable {
                    Button {
                        Task {
                            do {
                                if isTranscribing {
                                    try await call.stopTranscription()
                                } else {
                                    try await call.startTranscription()
                                }
                            } catch {
                                log.error(error)
                            }
                        }
                    } label: {
                        Label {
                            Text(isTranscribing ? "Disable Transcription" : "Transcription")
                        } icon: {
                            Image(
                                systemName: isTranscribing
                                ? "captions.bubble.fill"
                                : "captions.bubble"
                            )
                        }
                    }
                    .onReceive(call.state.$transcribing) { isTranscribing = $0 }
                }
            }
            .onReceive(call.state.$settings) {
                guard let mode = $0?.transcription.mode else {
                    isTranscriptionAvailable = false
                    return
                }
                isTranscriptionAvailable = mode != .disabled
            }
        }
    }
}
```
