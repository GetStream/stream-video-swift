# Camera zoom

Zooming the local participant's camera is a feature that users will look into when using your app. Fortunately the StreamVideo SDK makes that easy for you by taking care of all interactions with the `AVCaptureSession` and the `AVCaptureDevice`. 

Zoom factors are limited with the following: `1 < zoomFactor < activeCaptureDevice.activeFormat.videoMaxZoomFactor`.

In order to zoom you can simply call the method on the `Call` instance by providing the desired zoomFactor:

```swift
try call.zoom(by: 1.5)
```
