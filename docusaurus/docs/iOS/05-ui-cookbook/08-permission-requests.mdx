Different call participants can have different capabilities and permissions. Depending on your app's requirements, some users might be able to request additional permissions during a call. More details about permissions [here](../../guides/permissions-and-moderation).

When a user asks for additional capabilities, the hosts of the call receive an event that they can react to (approve or deny the request). You can listen to these events by subscribing to the `subscribe(for:)` async stream:

```swift
func subscribeForPermissionsRequests() {
    Task {
        for await request in call.subscribe(for: PermissionRequestEvent.self) {
            self.permissionRequest = request
        }
    }
}
```

The simplest way to present these is via alerts in SwiftUI, with two buttons for approving or denying the permission request.

```swift
YourHostView()
	.alert(isPresented: $viewModel.permissionPopupShown) {
    	Alert(
        	title: Text("Permission request"),
        	message: Text("\(viewModel.permissionRequest?.user.name ?? "Someone") raised their hand to speak."),
        	primaryButton: .default(Text("Allow")) {
            	viewModel.grantUserPermissions()
        	},
        	secondaryButton: .cancel()
    	)
}
```

Depending on your app's UI, you can also easily build a more customized version of this view.
