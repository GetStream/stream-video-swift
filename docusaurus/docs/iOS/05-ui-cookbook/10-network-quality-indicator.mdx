Network quality can impact the video experience a lot. Therefore, it's always a good idea to display the network quality of the participants in the call.

### Network quality in a call

When you are in a call, the network quality for each participant is delivered from the server. It's available via the `connectionQuality` property for each `CallParticipant`. The connection quality property can have the following values:

```swift
public enum ConnectionQuality: Sendable {
    case unknown
    case poor
    case good
    case excellent
}
```

By default, the SwiftUI SDK displays this information in the `VideoCallParticipantModifier`, via the `ConnectionQualityIndicator` view.

```swift
ConnectionQualityIndicator(connectionQuality: participant.connectionQuality)
```

Additionally, you can change the size and the width of the connection quality ticks, by passing the `size` and `width` parameters to the `ConnectionQualityIndicator` view.

If you wish to change this behaviour, you should implement the `makeVideoCallParticipantModifier` method and provide your own implementation that can modify or hide this view.
