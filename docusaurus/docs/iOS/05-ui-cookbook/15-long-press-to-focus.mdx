# Long Press to Focus

The StreamVideo SDK allows for interactive and intuitive user engagement during calls. Implementing a long press gesture to focus your local participant's video feed can significantly enhance the user experience.

## Overview

- **Focus Implementation**: Focus on the specified point on your video feed.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Detect a long press or a tap on a participant's video feed.
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interaction for a more immersive call experience.

## Implementing Long Press to Focus

### Focusing on a point in the Video Feed

In order to focus the camera at the desired point, we need to forward the request to the WebRTC videoCapturer. Before we do that we need to create a call and then join it:
```swift
// Create the call with the callType and id
let call = streamVideo.call(callType: "default", callId: "123")

// Create the call on server side
let creationResult = try await call.create()

// Join the call
let joinResult = try await call.join()
```

Once we are in the call, we can leverage the StreamVideo SDK to focus on a specific point on our **local video stream**:

```swift
// Retrieve the desired focus point(e.g using a tap or longPress gesture)
let focusPoint: CGPoint = CGPoint(x: 50, y: 50)

// and pass it to our call
try call.focus(at: focusPoint)
```

:::note
It's worth mentioning here that:
1. The focus on a point depends on the device's capabilities as the camera needs to support it.
2. We can only set the focus point for our local video stream and not for any of the other participants.

### Detecting the Long Press Gesture

You can find an implementation that we are using in our Demo app to focus on long press. To achieve that we are using the following ViewModifier:
```swift
struct LongPressToFocusViewModifier: ViewModifier {

    var availableFrame: CGRect

    var handler: (CGPoint) -> Void

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .gesture(
                LongPressGesture(minimumDuration: 0.5)
                    .sequenced(before: DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0, coordinateSpace: .local))
                    .onEnded { value in
                        switch value {
                        case .second(true, let drag):
                            if let location = drag?.location {
                                handler(convertToPointOfInterest(location))
                            }
                        default:
                            break
                        }
                    }
            )
    }

    func convertToPointOfInterest(_ point: CGPoint) -> CGPoint {
        CGPoint(
            x: point.y / availableFrame.height,
            y: 1.0 - point.x / availableFrame.width
        )
    }
}
```

We can then define a View extension to allow us easily use the ViewModifier:
```swift
extension View {
    @ViewBuilder
    func longPressToFocus(
        availableFrame: CGRect,
        handler: @escaping (CGPoint) -> Void
    ) -> some View {
        modifier(
            LongPressToFocusViewModifier(
                availableFrame: availableFrame,
                handler: handler
            )
        )
    }
}
```

### Modifying the UI SDK

In order to use our ViewModifier and we can leverage the ViewFactory that the SDK ships with. By subclassing it we can override the method that provides the `VideoCallParticipantModifier` like below:

```swift
override func makeVideoCallParticipantModifier(
    participant: CallParticipant,
    call: Call?,
    availableFrame: CGRect,
    ratio: CGFloat,
    showAllInfo: Bool
) -> some ViewModifier {
    super.makeVideoCallParticipantModifier(
        participant: participant,
        call: call,
        availableFrame: availableFrame,
        ratio: ratio,
        showAllInfo: showAllInfo
    )
    .longPressToFocus(availableFrame: availableFrame) {
        guard call?.state.sessionId == participant.sessionId else { return } // We are using this to only allow long pressing on our local video feed
        try? call?.focus(at: $0)
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing a long press to focus feature enhances user interaction, allowing participants to easily highlight and engage in a StreamVideo call. With customization options available developers have the flexibility to create a tailored and intuitive user experience.
