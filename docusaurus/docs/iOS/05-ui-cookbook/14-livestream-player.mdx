As described in our livestream [tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/ios/tutorial/livestreaming/), there are two ways of watching a livestream with StreamVideo's SDK: HLS and WebRTC. 

Watching an HLS livestream can be done using Apple's native [AVPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer/).

If you want to watch a WebRTC livestream, then you can either use our `LivestreamPlayer`, or build your own component.

Our `LivestreamPlayer` provides a standard livestreaming experience:

- shows a live indicator
- shows the duration of the livestream
- shows the number of participants
- possibility to enter/leave full screen
- possibility to pause/resume the livestream

### Usage

The `LivestreamPlayer` is a SwiftUI view that can be created with the livestream ID and the call type:

```swift
LivestreamPlayer(type: "livestream", id: "some_id")
```

You can show it, for example, via a `NavigationLink`, or as part of your own custom views.

```swift
NavigationLink {
    LivestreamPlayer(type: "livestream", id: "vQyteZAnDYYk")
} label: {
    Text("Join stream")
}
```

Make sure that the livestream id exists, and the call is not in backstage mode. Otherwise, the player will show a livestream not started error.

### Customization options

Apart from the required parameters, you can also specify some optional ones in the `LivestreamPlayer`'s init method:

- `muted`: `Bool` - whether the livestream audio should be on when joining the stream (default is `false`).
- `showParticipantCount`: `Bool` - whether the participant count should be shown (default is `true`).
- `onFullScreenStateChange`: `((Bool) -> ())?` - closure that is invoked when the full screen state changes. Useful if you use the livestream component as part of your custom views, since this is the chance to update the visibility of your custom UI elements.

## Accessing the livestream track

You can also build your own version of a livestream player, depending on your requirements. In those cases, you need to have access to the livestream track (or tracks).

If there is only one video track (you only have one person livestreaming), you can get it with the following code:

```swift
let livestream = call.state.participants.first(where: { $0.track != nil })
```

If you have multiple hosts that are livestreaming, and you want to show them all, you can fetch the hosts by role:

```swift
var hosts: [CallParticipant] {
    call.state.participants.filter { $0.roles.contains("host") }
}
```

Then, you can access the video track they are streaming, with the `track` property.
