/// The modifier designed to dynamically track and respond to the visibility status of a view within its parent
/// bounds or viewport. It utilises a user-defined visibility threshold, represented as a percentage, to
/// determine how much of the view should be visible (both vertically and horizontally) before it's considered
/// "on screen".
///
/// When the visibility state of the view changes (i.e., it transitions between being "on screen" and "off screen"),
/// a callback is triggered to notify the user of this change. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where
/// resource management is crucial, such as video playback or dynamic content loading, where actions might
/// be triggered based on whether a view is currently visible to the user.
///
/// By default, the threshold is set to 30%, meaning 30% of the view's dimensions must be within the parent's
/// bounds for it to be considered visible.
