/// A class managing a pool of pixel buffers to optimize memory usage during video processing.
///
/// A CVPixelBufferPool is instrumental in optimizing video processing and real-time image manipulation by
/// enhancing memory efficiency and performance. It achieves this by reusing pixel buffers, which curtails
/// the frequent allocation and deallocation of memory, a common bottleneck in real-time processing.
///
/// This reuse not only boosts performance but also aids in effective resource management, maintaining a
/// controlled memory footprint and preventing memory pressure. The pool ensures that all buffers share
/// consistent attributes like size and format, crucial for operations expecting uniform input.
///
/// Additionally, it reduces memory fragmentation, contributing to overall system stability and efficiency.
/// Essentially, CVPixelBufferPool streamlines handling high volumes of image or video frames, ensuring
/// optimized, consistent, and fast processing.
