/// A class dedicated to converting YUV (YpCbCr) image data to ARGB format.
final class StreamYUVToARGBConversion {

    /// Enum defining the color conversion coefficients for YUV to ARGB conversion.
    ///
    /// The coefficient in the context of `vImageConvert_YpCbCrToARGB_GenerateConversion`
    /// refers to a set of values used to define the color conversion matrix when transforming YpCbCr pixel
    /// format images to ARGB format. This conversion is crucial in image and video processing where color
    /// space compatibility is necessary for various rendering, compositing, or display purposes.
    ///
    /// Understanding YpCbCr to ARGB Conversion YpCbCr is a color space used in video compression
    /// and broadcasting, where Yp represents the luma component (the brightness), and Cb and Cr
    /// represent the chroma components (the color details). Converting YpCbCr to ARGB (Alpha, Red, Green, Blue)
    /// involves transforming these components into a format commonly used in digital images, which
    /// includes separate channels for red, green, blue, and an alpha transparency channel.
    ///
    /// Role of the Coefficient
    /// - Color Space Transformation: The coefficients are used to create a matrix that mathematically
    /// transforms the YpCbCr values into RGB values. This matrix accounts for the differences in color
    /// representation between the two formats, ensuring accurate color rendition.
    ///
    /// - Handling Various Standards: Different video standards (like ITU-R BT.601, ITU-R BT.709, etc.)
    /// define different coefficients because they assume different color primaries (red, green, and blue points)
    /// and different luma/chroma formulations. The coefficient matrix you choose should match the standard
    /// used when the YpCbCr data was originally created to ensure color accuracy.
    ///
    /// - Performance Optimization: Using a precalculated conversion matrix (which the coefficients help define)
    /// allows for highly optimized, performant image processing. This is critical in real-time applications,
    /// like video playback or editing, where processing speed is crucial.
    ///
    /// - Adjusting Luminance and Chrominance: The coefficients can also adjust the scale and bias of the
    /// luminance (Yp) and chrominance (Cb and Cr) to match the expected range of the ARGB format.
    /// This is essential for maintaining the correct brightness, contrast, and color saturation in the
    /// converted image.
    ///
    /// Usage in `vImageConvert_YpCbCrToARGB_GenerateConversion`
    /// When you use `vImageConvert_YpCbCrToARGB_GenerateConversion`, you typically provide a
    /// `vImage_YpCbCrToARGB` structure that includes the coefficients. The function then uses these
    /// coefficients to populate the structure with the necessary data to perform the conversion efficiently.
    /// The populated structure can subsequently be used with other vImage functions to convert image
    /// buffers from YpCbCr to ARGB.
    ///
    /// The correct selection and use of the coefficient matrix are vital for achieving accurate color conversion,
    /// maintaining image quality, and ensuring consistency across various processing stages or devices.
    /// The ability to specify different coefficients makes the vImage framework flexible and capable of
    /// handling various video standards and custom conversion needs.
    ///
