extension Stream_Video_Sfu_Models_PublishOption {

    /// Generates an array of video layers based on the publish option's dimensions and bitrate.
    ///
    /// - Parameter qualities: An array of `VideoLayer.Quality` values representing the desired
    ///   quality levels for the video layers. Defaults to `[.full, .half, .quarter]`.
    /// - Returns: An array of `VideoLayer` instances, ordered from lowest quality to highest.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    /// This method creates video layers by progressively scaling down the base video dimensions
    /// and bitrate for each quality level provided. The resulting layers are optimized for
    /// streaming environments, enabling adaptive video quality based on network conditions.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```swift
    /// let publishOption = Stream_Video_Sfu_Models_PublishOption(
    ///     videoDimension: CMVideoDimensions(width: 1920, height: 1080),
    ///     bitrate: 4000
    /// )
    /// let videoLayers = publishOption.videoLayers()
    /// print(videoLayers) // [Quarter, Half, Full]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Notes
    /// - The method assumes that lower-quality layers are created by halving the dimensions
    ///   and bitrate for each successive quality level.
    /// - The layers are returned in reverse order to prioritize lower-quality layers first.
