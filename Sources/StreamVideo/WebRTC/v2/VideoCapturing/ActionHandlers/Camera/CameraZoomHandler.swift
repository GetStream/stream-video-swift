    /// the active format is greater than 1.0. If these conditions are met, it proceeds to apply the requested
    /// zoom factor, clamping it within the supported range to avoid exceeding the device's capabilities.

    /// - Parameter factor: The desired zoom factor. A value of 1.0 represents no zoom, while values
    /// greater than 1.0 increase the zoom level. The factor is clamped to the maximum zoom factor supported
    /// by the device to ensure it remains within valid bounds.
    ///
    /// - Throws: `ClientError.Unexpected` if the video capturer is not of type
    /// `RTCCameraVideoCapturer`, or if the device does not support zoom. Also, throws an error if
    /// locking the device for configuration fails.
    ///
    /// - Note: This method should be used cautiously, as setting a zoom factor significantly beyond the
    /// optimal range can degrade video quality.
