/// A class that defines video capture policies used by the `LocalVideoAdapter`
/// to adjust video capture quality based on instructions from the SFU
/// (Selective Forwarding Unit).
///
/// ## Overview
/// On devices with limited processing power, video capture often starts at
/// full quality, even if the SFU requests lower quality streams (e.g., half
/// or quarter resolution). This mismatch can result in unnecessary processing
/// overhead as the device continues to capture at a higher quality than needed.
///
/// By aligning the capture quality with the SFU's requests, `VideoCapturePolicy`
/// helps reduce processing costs and improves performance, particularly on
/// older or less powerful devices.
public class VideoCapturePolicy: @unchecked Sendable {

    /// Updates the video capture quality based on active encodings and the current session.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - activeEncodings: A set of strings representing the active encoding qualities.
    ///   - activeSession: The current video capture session, if any.
    ///
    /// Override this method in subclasses to implement specific policies for
    /// adjusting capture quality. By default, this method performs no action.

/// A concrete implementation of `VideoCapturePolicy` that dynamically adapts
/// video capture quality based on system conditions and SFU requests.
///
/// ## Features
/// - Adjusts video capture quality when the device's thermal state is `.serious`
///   or higher, or when the device lacks a neural engine.
/// - Only updates capture quality if the requested encodings differ from the
///   currently active encodings.
/// - Requires an active video capture session to make adjustments.
