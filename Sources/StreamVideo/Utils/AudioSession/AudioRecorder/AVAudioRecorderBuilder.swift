/// A builder class that simplifies the creation and management of
/// `AVAudioRecorder` instances for audio recording.
///
/// This builder provides:
/// - **Caching**: Stores created `AVAudioRecorder` objects for efficient
///   reuse, avoiding redundant initialization
/// - **Customizable settings**: Allows you to tailor recording parameters
///   to your specific needs
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```swift
/// let builder = AVAudioRecorderBuilder()
/// try builder.build()
/// let recorder = builder.result
/// ```
///
/// - Important: You must call ``build()`` before trying to access the
///   ``result`` property.

    /// during a call).
    ///
