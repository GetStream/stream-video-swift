/// A high-level audio recorder for managing audio recording during calls.
///
/// This class provides a simplified interface for audio recording,
/// abstracting the complexity of `AVAudioRecorder` management and audio
/// session configuration. It automatically handles:
/// - Recording permissions
/// - Audio session category management
/// - Interruption handling
/// - Active call synchronization
/// - Real-time audio level monitoring
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let recorder = StreamCallAudioRecorder()
///
/// // Subscribe to audio levels
/// recorder.metersPublisher.sink { level in
///     print("Audio level: \(level) dB")
/// }
///
/// // Start recording
/// await recorder.startRecording()
///
/// // Stop recording
/// await recorder.stopRecording()
/// ```
///
/// ## Automatic Behavior
///
/// By default, the recorder synchronizes with the active call state:
/// - Starts recording when the user enables their microphone in a call
/// - Stops recording when the call ends or microphone is disabled
/// - Handles interruptions gracefully (phone calls, alarms, etc.)
open class StreamCallAudioRecorder: @unchecked Sendable {
    /// The current audio power level in decibels (dB).
    ///
    /// This property is continuously updated during recording to reflect
    /// the real-time audio input level. Values typically range from:
    /// - `-160 dB`: Complete silence or no input
    /// - `-60 dB` to `-40 dB`: Very quiet speech
    /// - `-40 dB` to `-20 dB`: Normal speech
    /// - `-20 dB` to `0 dB`: Loud speech or noise
    /// - `0 dB`: Maximum level (clipping may occur)
    ///
    /// The value updates at the display refresh rate (typically 60Hz) for
    /// smooth UI animations.
    ///
    /// ## Usage Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Observe meter changes with Combine
    /// recorder.$meters
    ///     .map { dB in
    ///         // Convert dB to normalized value (0...1)
    ///         return max(0, min(1, (dB + 160) / 160))
    ///     }
    ///     .sink { normalizedLevel in
    ///         updateWaveformUI(level: normalizedLevel)
    ///     }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Note: Returns `0` when recording is not active.
    @Published open private(set) var meters: Float = 0

    /// Indicates whether audio recording is currently active.
    ///
    /// This property reflects the actual recording state, which may differ
    /// from the desired state due to:
    /// - Missing microphone permissions
    /// - Audio session interruptions (phone calls, alarms)
    /// - Audio session category incompatibility
    /// - System resource constraints
    ///
    /// ## Observable
    ///
    /// As a `@Published` property, you can observe changes using Combine:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// recorder.$isRecording
    ///     .sink { isRecording in
    ///         updateRecordingUI(active: isRecording)
    ///     }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## State Synchronization
    ///
    /// This property automatically synchronizes with:
    /// - Active call microphone state
    /// - Audio session interruptions
    /// - Application lifecycle events
    ///
    /// - Important: Always check this property to determine the actual
    ///   recording state rather than assuming recording started successfully
    ///   after calling `startRecording()`.

    /// voice recording during calls. During initialization:
    /// 1. Creates the internal state store
    /// 2. Sets up bindings between store state and published properties
    /// 3. Prepares middleware for handling recording lifecycle
    ///
    /// The recorder automatically synchronizes its `isRecording` and
    /// `meters` properties with the internal store state, ensuring UI
    /// updates happen on the main thread.
