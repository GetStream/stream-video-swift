/// A high-level audio recorder for managing audio recording during calls.
///
/// This class provides a simplified interface for audio recording,
/// abstracting the complexity of `AVAudioRecorder` management and audio
/// session configuration. It automatically handles:
/// - Recording permissions
/// - Audio session category management
/// - Interruption handling
/// - Active call synchronization
/// - Real-time audio level monitoring
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let recorder = StreamCallAudioRecorder()
///
/// // Subscribe to audio levels
/// recorder.metersPublisher.sink { level in
///     print("Audio level: \(level) dB")
/// }
///
/// // Start recording
/// await recorder.startRecording()
///
/// // Stop recording
/// await recorder.stopRecording()
/// ```
///
/// ## Automatic Behavior
///
/// By default, the recorder synchronizes with the active call state:
/// - Starts recording when the user enables their microphone in a call
/// - Stops recording when the call ends or microphone is disabled
/// - Handles interruptions gracefully (phone calls, alarms, etc.)
open class StreamCallAudioRecorder: @unchecked Sendable {
    /// The internal store managing recording state.
    private let store = Namespace.store(initialState: .initial)

    /// Publisher that emits real-time audio power levels during recording.
    ///
    /// The published values represent the average power in decibels (dB),
    /// typically ranging from -160 dB (silence) to 0 dB (maximum level).
    /// Updates are published at the display refresh rate for smooth UI
    /// updates.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// recorder.metersPublisher
    ///     .map { dB in
    ///         // Convert dB to normalized value (0...1)
    ///         return (dB + 160) / 160
    ///     }
    ///     .sink { normalizedLevel in
    ///         updateWaveformUI(level: normalizedLevel)
    ///     }
    /// ```
    open private(set) lazy var metersPublisher: AnyPublisher<Float, Never> = store
        .publisher(\.meter)

    /// Initializes a new audio recorder instance.
    ///
    /// The recorder is initialized with default settings optimized for
    /// voice recording during calls.

    ///   of a call context.

    ///   prompt for permission if not already granted.

    ///
