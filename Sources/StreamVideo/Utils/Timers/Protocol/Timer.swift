    /// The timer fires once after the given time interval. The `onFire` callback

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - timeInterval: Seconds until the timer fires.
    ///   - queue: The queue where the `onFire` callback is executed. It can be a

    ///   - onFire: Callback triggered when the timer fires.
