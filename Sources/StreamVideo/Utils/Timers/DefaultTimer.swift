 Default real-world implementations of the ``Timer`` protocol.

 These timers are based on ``DispatchQueue`` and ``DispatchSourceTimer``,
 allowing precise control of scheduling on custom queues. This ensures that
 timers are not bound to the main thread and can run in background contexts.

    /// main thread and can run on any queue you provide.

    ///   - timeInterval: Delay in seconds before the timer fires.
