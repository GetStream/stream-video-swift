/// A custom serial executor that manages task execution on a dispatch queue.
///
/// `DispatchQueueExecutor` implements Swift's `SerialExecutor` protocol to
/// provide ordered task execution using Grand Central Dispatch. It maintains
/// a queue of jobs and ensures they are executed serially while providing
/// cancellation capabilities for pending tasks.
///
/// The executor uses a dispatch queue as its underlying execution mechanism
/// and tracks enqueued jobs with unique identifiers to enable selective
/// cancellation of pending work.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class is marked as `@unchecked Sendable` because it manages its own
/// thread safety through the underlying dispatch queue and atomic operations
/// on the job tracking dictionary.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let executor = DispatchQueueExecutor()
/// // Jobs will be automatically enqueued when used with Swift actors
/// ```
final class DispatchQueueExecutor: SerialExecutor, TaskExecutor, @unchecked Sendable {
    /// A token used to track and cancel individual enqueued jobs.
    ///
    /// Each job submitted to the executor gets an associated `CancelToken`
    /// that can be used to mark the job as cancelled before it begins
    /// execution. This provides fine-grained control over task cancellation.
    ///
    /// The token is thread-safe and uses simple boolean state to track
    /// cancellation status.
    final class CancelToken: @unchecked Sendable {
        /// Whether this token has been cancelled.
        ///
        /// Once set to `true`, the associated job should not be executed
        /// even if it's already been enqueued on the dispatch queue.
        fileprivate(set) var isCancelled = false

        /// Marks this token as cancelled.
        ///
        /// After calling this method, any job associated with this token
        /// should skip execution when it reaches the front of the queue.
        func cancel() { isCancelled = true }
    }

    /// The underlying dispatch queue that executes jobs serially.
    ///
    /// This queue ensures that all jobs are executed one at a time in the
    /// order they were submitted, providing the serial execution guarantee
    /// required by the `SerialExecutor` protocol.
    private let queue: DispatchQueue
    
    /// A dictionary tracking all currently enqueued jobs by their unique IDs.
    ///
    /// This atomic property maps job identifiers to their cancellation tokens,
    /// allowing the executor to cancel specific jobs before they execute.
    /// Jobs are automatically removed from this dictionary after execution.
    @Atomic private var enqueuedJobs: [UUID: CancelToken] = [:]

    /// Creates a new executor with an automatically generated queue label.

    /// scheduled for execution. Each job gets a unique identifier and
    /// cancellation token for tracking purposes.
