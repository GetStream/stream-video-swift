/// A logger for recording store operations and debugging state changes.
///
/// The store logger provides visibility into the action processing
/// pipeline, logging successful completions and failures. It can be
/// subclassed to customize logging behavior for specific stores.
///
/// ## Customization
///
/// Subclass this logger to:
/// - Filter or aggregate certain actions
/// - Add custom formatting
/// - Send metrics to analytics
/// - Implement performance monitoring
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// class CustomLogger: StoreLogger<MyNamespace> {
///     override func didComplete(
///         identifier: String,
///         action: Action,
///         state: State,
///         file: StaticString,
///         function: StaticString,
///         line: UInt
///     ) {
///         // Custom logging logic
///         if case .criticalAction = action {
///             sendAnalytics(action: action)
///         }
///         super.didComplete(...)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
