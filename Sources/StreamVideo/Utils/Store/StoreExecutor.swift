/// Executes store actions by coordinating middleware, reducers, and
/// logging.
///
/// The executor is responsible for the complete action processing
/// pipeline:
/// 1. Applying optional delay before processing
/// 2. Running middleware for side effects
/// 3. Processing reducers to generate new state
/// 4. Logging the results
/// 5. Publishing state updates
/// 6. Applying optional delay after processing
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// The executor itself is not thread-safe. Thread safety should be
/// managed by the calling store through serial execution queues.
///
/// - Note: This is an internal component of the store architecture and
///   should not be used directly.

    /// This method orchestrates the complete action processing flow,

    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - identifier: The store identifier for logging.
    ///   - state: The current state before processing.
    ///   - action: The action to process.
    ///   - delay: Configuration for delays before and after processing.
    ///   - reducers: Array of reducers to apply to the action.
    ///   - middleware: Array of middleware for side effects.
    ///   - logger: Logger for recording action results.
    ///   - subject: Publisher to emit the new state.
    ///   - file: Source file of the action dispatch.
    ///   - function: Function name of the action dispatch.
    ///   - line: Line number of the action dispatch.
    ///
    /// - Throws: Any error thrown by reducers during processing.
    ///
    /// - Note: The execution flow is:
    ///   1. Apply `delay.before` if specified
    ///   2. Notify middleware of the action
    ///   3. Process reducers to generate new state
    ///   4. Publish the new state
    ///   5. Apply `delay.after` if specified (only on success)
