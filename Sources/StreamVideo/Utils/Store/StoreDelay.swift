extension Store {

    /// Defines timing delays for action processing in the store.
    ///
    /// The `Delay` struct allows you to specify delays before and/or after
    /// an action is processed. This is useful for:
    /// - Debouncing rapid action dispatches
    /// - Creating artificial delays for testing
    /// - Smoothing UI transitions
    /// - Rate limiting certain operations
    ///
    /// ## Usage Examples
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // No delay (default)
    /// store.dispatch(.someAction, delay: .none())
    ///
    /// // Delay before processing
    /// store.dispatch(.someAction, delay: .init(before: 0.5))
    ///
    /// // Delay after processing
    /// store.dispatch(.someAction, delay: .init(after: 0.3))
    ///
    /// // Delay both before and after
    /// store.dispatch(.someAction, delay: .init(before: 0.2, after: 0.1))
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Execution Flow
    ///
    /// When delays are specified, the action processing follows this order:
    /// 1. Wait for `before` delay (if > 0)
    /// 2. Process middleware
    /// 3. Process reducers
    /// 4. Update state
    /// 5. Wait for `after` delay (if > 0)
    struct Delay: Equatable {
        /// The delay in seconds to wait before processing the action.
        ///
        /// Default is 0 (no delay). The delay occurs before middleware and
        /// reducers are executed.
        var before: TimeInterval = 0
        
        /// The delay in seconds to wait after processing the action.
        ///
        /// Default is 0 (no delay). The delay occurs after the state has
        /// been updated but before the next action in the queue is processed.
        var after: TimeInterval = 0

        /// Creates a delay configuration with no delays.
        ///
        /// This is equivalent to `Delay(before: 0, after: 0)`.
        ///
        /// - Returns: A delay configuration with no delays.
        static func none() -> Delay { .init() }

        /// Applies the before delay if one is configured.
        ///
        /// This method is called internally by the store executor before
        /// processing the action. If `before` is 0 or negative, this method
        /// returns immediately.
        func applyDelayBeforeIfRequired() async {
            guard before > 0 else { return }
            await wait(for: before)
        }

        /// Applies the after delay if one is configured.
        ///
        /// This method is called internally by the store executor after
        /// successfully processing the action. If `after` is 0 or negative,
        /// this method returns immediately.
        ///
        /// - Note: The after delay is not applied if the action processing
        ///   throws an error.
        func applyDelayAfterIfRequired() async {
            guard after > 0 else { return }
            await wait(for: after)
        }

        /// Waits for the specified number of seconds.
        ///
        /// Uses `Task.sleep` for the delay, which is cancellation-aware.
        /// If the task is cancelled, the delay ends immediately.
        ///
        /// - Parameter seconds: The number of seconds to wait.
        private func wait(for seconds: TimeInterval) async {
            try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(1_000_000_000 * seconds))
